LambdaLifter

Description:
An interactive version of the ASCII-Game "LambdaLifter" as described in the ICFP PC 2012 task.
You can find more information the official site:
http://icfpcontest2012.wordpress.com/

You can find the full specification of the game here:
http://www-fp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~icfppc/task.pdf

Usage:
1. Compile "Main.hs"
   $> ghc Main.hs
2. Run "Main" with maps as arguments, e.g.
   $> ./Main ../maps/*.map



Currently missing:
- no scoring
- not all extensions are implemented (see below)
  
Extensions:

They posted a few specification extensions:
- Weather				(not implemented)
- Trampolines
- Beards and Razors		(not implemented (yet))
- Higher Order Rocks	(not implemented (yet))

The only extension implemented right now is "Trampolines".
I may implement 'Beards and Razors' next, maybe "Higher Order Rocks" after that. 
I don't know how to properly visualize the "Weather" extension, so i may skip that one.

Development notes:
- This is my first "real" Haskell program, so there is probably a lot of code that will make an experienced Haskell user shiver ;)
- No proper (inline) documentation yet (haddock seems to be the universally accepted documentation tool, I have to look into that..)
- No consistent (indentation) style - still getting used to haskell
- Almost no usage of appropriate monads
- No proper parsing (e.g. metadata for the extensions) - i may read up on parsec
- Chaotic code structure - how to structure and use modules doesn't seem to be as obvious in FP as it is in OOP - coupled with FP/Haskell being very new to me...

Any sort of advice or criticism is very much appreciated!
